				Papa Juans was established early into the pandemic when Papa J. saw the need for better, cheaper food
				for a
				struggling economy, broken by the pandemic. Papa J. who at the time had been working within the hospital
				industry fighting the coronavirus pandemic final decided to set up shop on August 24, 2020. When his
				co-worker, a fellow medical professional heard of his efforts, word was put into the hospital
				organization
				and Papa J. received funding to aid in the effort. Their help was not forgotten, and to pay it even
				further
				to those in need, Papa J. began his initiative to further help those in need by declaring the
				organization
				permanent position in supporting the doctors without borders cause. You can visit the non-profit
				organization by pressing the links below.
